# Domino’s Pizza Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Domino’s Pizza sales data
to understand order patterns, revenue drivers, and product performance.

The objective of this project is not only to analyze data using SQL,
but also to practice structured insight communication and business thinking.

## Tools & Technologies
- PostgreSQL (SQL querying)
- Power BI (data validation & visualization)
- PowerPoint (insight presentation)

## Analysis Overview
The analysis covers:
- Month-over-month order volume trends
- Orders by hour of the day
- Revenue contribution by pizza size
- Top pizzas by revenue
- Category-wise order distribution
- Average order size

## Project Artifacts
- Final insights are documented in the presentation attached below.

## Data & Query Access
- The dataset and SQL queries are intentionally not included
  to maintain originality and avoid direct reuse.
- This repository is meant to showcase analytical thinking,
  insight structure, and communication approach.

## Key Insights Summary
- Order demand remains relatively stable across most months, with short-term fluctuations rather than sustained decline.
- Peak order volumes occur between midday and early evening hours, indicating concentrated operational load during this window.
- A small set of pizzas contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue.
- Standard pizza sizes generate most of the revenue, indicating clear customer size preferences.
- Average order size suggests moderate purchasing behavior rather than bulk ordering.
